First of all, thanks for considering contributing to multivents! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Whether you want to report a bug, request a change or start a discussion, you want to go to multivent's [Github Issues](https://github.com/objectliteral/multivents/issues). There is no template for bug reports or anything, so don't worry about formalities.

I am happy to receive any kind of feedback and contributions. Read below to find out, how to best contribute to multivents.

## What to contribute

- Bug Reports. I am more than happy for any bug reports. Multivents uses quite a lot of unit tests, that give me confidence in multivents reliability. But there is always the chance of a bug slipping through the cracks. If you find one, report it as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/objectliteral/multivents/issues).
- Bug Fixes. Found a bug and already know, how to fix it?! Great! You're welcome to shoot me a PR.
- Minor code optimizations. Of course, performance as well as file size are important for multivents. But so is code maintainability. So as much as I appreciate improvements in performance, please stick to changes that do not compromise code readability.
- Tests. Multivents is quite well tested with over 150 unit tests and [above 95% code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/objectliteral/multivents). But more tests, rarely hurt. One aspect that specifically needs testing at the moment is running multivents in a browser environments.
- Documentation. Multivents is heavily documented, but I feel that there is a lot of room for improvements in terms of language style and clarity. If you're a decent writer, I welcome you to overhaul the documentation's language.

## What **NOT** to contribute

I do not mean to be rude, but there are types of contributions that are less wanted right now. But of course I am open to discussion, so post your requests, suggestions, ideas as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/objectliteral/multivents/issues).

- Major code refactors. I am pretty satisfied with the style of code, multivents uses. I do not need any code refactoring to be done and these kinds of PR are unlikely to get merged.
- Features. I am currently not looking for feature requests. Feel free to implement them in your own fork.
